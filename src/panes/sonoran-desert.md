Located in southern California and Arizona, the Sonoran Desert wraps around the Gulf of California, extending south into Mexico to include most of Baja and about half of the state of Sonora. It has a tropic-subtropic climate in which freezing temperatures lasting 24 hours rarely occur. In contrast, the other North American deserts, Great Basin, Mojave, and Chihuahuan, are temperate and landlocked.

Its climate and biseasonal rainfall pattern make it one of our lushest deserts. The Sonoran Desert is populated by giant cacti, short trees, and a great variety of shrubbery.

Despite high summer temperatures exceeding 110 degrees Fahrenheit, the Sonoran Desert's southern location and moderate winters foster varied plant and animal life.
